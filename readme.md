# The Lightbox

## 1. Based on circus-starter
So clone a copy, `cd` into the folder, `npm install`, and `gulp` to get it going.

## 2. Take a look at the `assets/js/main.js` file.
Your homework is to make a working "lightbox." If you don't know the term, it's when
you click the thumbnail for an image, and it pops up bigger so you can see it better.
For an example, go here https://creativecircus.edu/programs/design/ and click one of the
images on the left.
